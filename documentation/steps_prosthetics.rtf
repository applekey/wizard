create global \'91undo\'92 button accessible at any point in process rather than specific ones for each step. Also global save as well that saves to \'91original file name_wizard.obj\'92\
\
Step 1:\
\
In step one you will import the model created during the scanning process\
press \'91import\'92 button \
use dialog box to select model \
\
When import pressed: \
	auto: import model \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural
\cf0 	auto: camera - fill screen, turn on vertices colour (so can see colour from scan) \

\cf0 \
Step 2: \
\
In step 2 you will start to remove unnecessary aspects captured during scan (e.g. top of the thigh and waist, counter, etc) and also create a flat surface on your model that will assist with the alignment of the socket later in this process  \
Rotate camera with mouse and \'91alt\'92 button until residual limb model is generally pointing down. \
Press \'91Plane Cut\'92 button when ready to begin \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural
\cf0 Using plane cut arrows and camera rotation, align the plane until the edges overlap with the aligned cutlines marked on the residual limb during scanning process\
Rotate camera to view all sides of the model and make sure the plane overlaps with all cutline marks on all sides\
When ready press \'91accept\'92 button  \
\
When plane cut button pressed: \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural
\cf0 	auto: select plane cut\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural
\cf0 When accept button pressed: \
	auto: execute plane cut \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural
\cf0 	auto: IF POSSIBLE: use plane from plane cut to align model to ground plane, then transform 	180 and place \'91toe\'92 of model on ground plane, recenter camera\
	auto: execute \'92save\'92 add \'91_wizard\'92 to filename and save in original location\
\
Step 3: \

\cf0 auto: select select tool\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural

\cf0 In step 3 you will remove any additional unnecessary aspects captured during scan, smooth, and repair any problems in the model. Click anywhere on the residual limb model to select a small section of it and press \'91clean up\'92 button when ready. \
Following clean up, rotate socket and examine for any issues, if OK press \'91done\'92, if not, press \'91undo\'92 one or more times to return to previous parts of this process\
\
When accept button pressed: \
	auto: execute \'91expand to connected\'92 \
	auto: execute \'91invert\'92 \
	auto: execute \'91discard\'92 \
	auto execute \'91select all\'92 \
	auto: execute \'91smooth\'92\
	auto: execute \'91inspector:auto repair\'92 \
\
When done button pressed: \
	auto: execute \'91done\'92 \
	auto: execute \'92save\'92 add \'91_edited\'92 to filename and save in original location - overwrite previous 	save\
	auto: open object browser, duplicate object, turn original invisible, select duplicate \
\
IF ALIGN TO PLANE CUT doesn\'92t work (in step 2) need to add align step here before proceeding\
\
Step 4: \
\
auto: select select tool \
\
In step 4 you will begin the process of rectifying the positive residual limb model, building up areas on it that correspond to areas marked during the scanning process. You can control the size of the select tool using the \'91tool slider\'92.\
\
Start by selecting the first region to add material and when ready, press \'91build up\'92 button. You can control the height and the shape of the material you add using the \'91height\'92 slider, and \'91falloff\'92 slider. To make it easier to see what you are adding, rotate the camera so that you are viewing the material you are adding in profile. When ready, press \'91accept\'92 and repeat the process for other areas to build up. \
\
auto: change size of select tool based on slider input \
\
when \'91build up\'92 button pressed: \
	auto: execute \'91modify - smooth boundary - accept \
	auto: execute \'91offset\'92 \
	auto: change \'91distance\'92 based on \'91height\'92 slider\
	auto: change \'91falloff\'92 based on \'91falloff\'92 slider\
\
when \'91accept\'92 button pressed: \
	auto: execute \'91offset accept\'92\
\
Step 5: \
\
auto: execute selection\
\
In step 5 you will create the relief for  the popiteal region of the residual limb. \
\
\
Start by selecting a small area within the popiteal region as marked during the scanning process. When ready to proceed, press \'91Begin build up\'92 \
A square will be created at the site of your selection. Use the \'91grow squares\'92 to Increase the width (green square) to match that of the residual limb and the height (red square) to slightly above the trim line as marked on the residual limb and to the bottom edge of the marked popiteal region. Rotate the camera until you have the limb and square in profile and then use the rotation arrow (blue) and possibly the blue and red arrows to position the top and bottom edges of the square so that it sits on a plane with the calf area of the residual limb. \
When ready press \'91continue build up\'92 \
Drag the brush over the now partially transparent square and press the left mouse button to fill in material between the residual limb and the square. Continue until the space is entirely filled.  \
When ready press \'91complete build up\'92 to finish the process. \
\
When \'91begin build up\'92 pressed: \
	auto: edit - fit primitive - square \
\
When \'91continue build up\'92 pressed: \
	auto: edit - fit primitive - square - accept\
	auto: edit - separate \
	auto: set new object to \'91attract\'92 \
	auto: select duplicate of original leg \
	auto: sculpt - attract brush \
\
when \'91complete build up\'92 pressed: \
	auto: delete square part\
	auto: select select tool\
	auto: execute \'92save\'92 add \'91_edited\'92 to filename and save in original location - overwrite previous 	save\
	auto: select duplicate of original leg \
\
Step 6\
\
auto:select all - clear face groups\
\
In Step 6 you will generate the socket from the now rectified positive model. \
\
Start by using the selection tool to trace the trim line for the socket as marked during the scanning process, Make sure to trace above the line rather than directly on the line and verify that the line is continuous and that there are no gaps. When ready to proceed, press \'91generate trim line\'92\
To generate a socket, double-click anywhere below the trim line to select the appropriate part of the model. Then, press \'91generate socket\'92 to create the socket. You can set the space between the residual limb and the socket using the \'91inner dimension\'92 slider and the thickness of the socket wall using the \'91outer dimension\'92 slider. \
\
When \'91generate trim line\'92 button pressed: \
	auto: modify - smooth boundary - accept \
	auto: modify create face group \
\
when \'91generate socket\'92 button pressed: \
	auto: edit - offset \
	auto: set distance to ID slider \
	auto: offset - accept \
	auto: edit - separate\
	auto: select new part \
	auto: edit - offset \
	auto: set distance to OD slider \
	auto: set offset - connected \
	auto offset - accept\
	auto: select new model object\
	auto: make other model objects invisible \
\
Step 7\
\
In Step 7 you will complete the socket by adding the pylon attachment fixture to the bottom and creating a hole to assist with the alignment process. When ready to proceed, press the \'91add fixture button\'92 \
Once the fixture is imported, drag it into the proper location on the model\
\
When \'91add fixture button pressed: \
	auto: import stl and align with ground plane. \
