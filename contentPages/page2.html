        Once in the recording tab, adjust the Delay Time and the Limit Time of
        Scanning. For this, drag the mouse cursor until you get the
        <u><b>time configurations</b></u>
        below. If you find that you require a different time, feel free to change
        these settings.

      Before scanning, keep in mind the following
      <u><b>technical requirements</b></u>
      :

           The effective range of the scanner (green area) is 23" (58cm) and 27" (68cm), so
          try to keep as much of the residual limb between this distance. Areas shown in 
          red are not being scanned accurately. Moving too quickly may result in a failed 
          scan. Instead, move slowly and steadily.
          </center>
        
        </b>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      Press the
      <u><b> Record </b></u>
      button to start scanning. To scan:
      <br>
      <br>
      <div id="roundBox">
        <b>
          <center>
          Move the scanner in a fluid arc around the residual limb, completing a 360° rota-
        tion around it. Start from one limb’s side holding the scan, standing up, holding 
        the scan in your arm lowest position, and scan for an entire round ending on the 
        other side of the limb with the scan viewing the bottom of the limb.Once a full 
        rotation has been completed, scan the base of the residual limb.
          </center>
        
        </b>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      Once you have finished the scan, press the Record button again to stop
      recording if the time is still running. The software will then produce
      a model. The model should be complete, with few or no holes, and few imperfections.
      If the model does not look accurate, press the Delete button and attempt
      another scan.
